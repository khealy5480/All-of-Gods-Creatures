All of God's Creatures got a place in the choir
Some sing low
Some sing higher
Some sing out aloud on the telephone wire
Some just clap their hands or paws or anything they got now
 
Top Listen to the top with the
little bird singing a melody and a high note stringin'
And the hoot owl he cries over everything and the
blackbird disagrees
Singin' in the night time singin' in the day
The little duck quacks
and he's on his way
And the otter hasn't got much to say
And the porcupine talks to himself
 
The dogs and the cats they take up the middle
Where the honey bee hums
And the prairie dog fiddles
Where the donkey brays
And the Pony neighs
And the ol' grey badger sighs
 
Listen to the bass it's the one on the bottom
Where the bull frog croaks
And the hippopotamus moans and groans with a big ta-do!
And the old cow just goes moo
